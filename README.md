## BLOP

BLOP is a social network I created as a portfolio project, designed to closely mirror the functionality of modern social media platforms. My goal was to make it as realistic and feature-rich as possible, providing users with an experience they would expect from todayâ€™s social networks.

## Project Features

### Posts and Interactions

- **Publish posts** with text, images, or videos.
- **Comment on posts** to engage in discussions.
- **Reply to comments**, allowing direct responses.
- **Nested replies** (similar to Reddit) for deeper conversations.

### Account & Profile Management

- **Edit and customize profile**, including:
  - Username
  - Profile name
  - Profile picture & banner
  - Bio
- **Change email** associated with the account.
- **Reset password** for account security.
- **Link multiple accounts** for seamless switching between them.

### Content Management

- **Save drafts** of posts, comments, and replies for later editing.
- **Edit posts, comments, and replies**, with a revision history to track changes.
- **Delete posts, comments, and replies** to remove unwanted content.

### Moderation Tools

- **Mute users** to hide their content.
- **Block users** to prevent interaction.
- **Filter content** by blocking specific words, hiding any content containing them.
